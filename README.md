# DumbCode Studio v1

The Dumbcode Studio v1 is meant to be the model for the first release version of the DumbCode Studio. We have had the great opportunity to work with out community to design this beutiful piece of software. We have gone through 3 main phases of the studio to get it to this point and we are very happt to bring it to the public finally after all these years!

## What does it do?

The DumbCode Studio is a conjunction of tools for creating entity mods for minecraft. It includes:
- A Project File Handler
- A Modeler
- An Animator
- Texturer and mapping tools
- A variety of export options, including to our Lib format DumbLibrary

## Project Management v2

The project page has always been the hub for the studio. This is the place where you start and finish all your projects. As the Studio evolved over this past year we found it to need a bit of an overhaul in what faces the user. We took the react rewrite as an opportunity to rethink it and make it the most user friendly the community has ever seen it.

## The Modeler

The modeler is the team's goal to take what we've learned from other modeling softwares like Tabula and Blockbench for Minecraft mods, and professional modeling softwares like Rhinoceros to create a fully functional piece of software for creating blocky style models for your games or mods in a more user friendly way than ever before.

Our command backed interface makes the software very easily expandable in the future and we plan to keep adding new features well into the future.

## The animator v3

The DumbCode animator v1 was a proof of concept to animate Tabula models for our minecraft mods that turned out to be a huge improvement to our workflow so we refined it in v2 with new features and a new style and allowed some community members to provide feedback too. The 3rd version is meant to be the final visual change for the animator and takes the v2 animator and makes it more accessible for any and all users. Those experienced with other softwares and even new animators will find this new version to be much simpler than before while allowing for more complex animations to take place in less screen realistate.

## The Texturer v2

In this version we've taken the Texturer to a new level. Originally we made the texturer to be a simple mapping tool with some painting options to make it easy to get your bearings on a model in an external texturing tool. We've decided to allow for the user to create a full worspace for texturing the models further than ever before in a tool like the studio.
